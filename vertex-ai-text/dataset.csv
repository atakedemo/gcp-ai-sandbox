"I have created an incredible indicator that actually makes money, unlike any other indicator I have ever seen","How the indicator works in a nutshell\n\nin 3 steps\n\nTouch detection\n1. Touch detection\n\nThe indicator automatically identifies strong support and resistance levels that the price has touched multiple times. Only those levels that the price has touched at least several times appear on the chart. The minimum number of touches is selected in the indicator settings. For active trading I use a minimum of 2 touches to display the level on the chart, for more passive trading I use a minimum of 3 touches.\n\nTouch detection area\n2. Touch detection area\n\nThe touch search area’s width is determined automatically through volatility analysis. This was the most difficult task. I needed to create my own volatility analysis, since the existing implementations didn’t fit.\n\nSends an alert\n3. Sends an alert\n\nAs soon as a new support or resistance level is detected on the chart, the indicator will draw it on the chart and send a notification\n\nWhy it works\n\n▸ For decades, people have been taught to put stop losses at the highs and lows of the price (depending on the direction of the trade). It was relevant 20 years ago, it works today and will work tomorrow. I can assume that you set stop losses in the same way.\n\n▸ The more often the price touched a level, the more participants appear who see this and enter a position in this place, at the same time putting a stop loss for the price minimum, as in the example.\n\n▸ When the price approaches the level again, it is broken by a large trader or many smaller ones. At this point, the stop losses of all those who placed them at the price minimum are activated en masse. When the price starts its strong movement, the rest of the stop losses, which were placed as far away as possible, are activated. This results in an avalanche of stop losses and the price rushes into space.\n\nHow to trade on the indicator. One of the options.\n\nin 3 steps\n\n1. Place an order\n\nAs soon as the indicator has drawn a new level on the chart or you have received a notification about it, place a Stop Market Buy order on the exchange just above the price indicated inside the level (You can enable the display in the indicator settings).\n\nIn this example, the maximum price is 2.7704, so the Stop Market Buy order should be placed at 2.7705.\nStop Loss should be placed at the minimum, which is also written inside the level.\n\n2. Waiting\n\nOnce the order is executed and you are notified, do not rush to close it too quickly, otherwise you may earn much less than you could.\n\n(The screenshot of the trade is not from tradingview, so the indicator is not shown here)\n\n3. Take a lot\n\nRemember that the main thing in trading is mathematical expectation. In trading, it is not and cannot be that all trades are profitable. That is the nature of the market.\n\nExample: Let’s say you received 10 Stop Losses in a row, which is an incredible amount. You lost 100 dollars in each of them. Minus $1,000. But the 11th trade, which you didn’t close immediately, brought you $6,000.\n\nBottom line: you made $5,000. To explain it as simply as possible, this is how it works. That’s what mathematical expectation is in trading.\n\nRemember that one good trade will offset the loss from even an incredible 10 bad trades.\n\nHow did this indicator “Support and resistance with touches [Paul Lenosky]” come about?\n\nI am a programmer by education, but for more than 7 years I have been living only from trading.\nI originally created this indicator for my mom. When she retired and felt lost and useless after working all her life as a hairdresser, I offered to teach her trading. What was needed was a simple indicator to help her trade.\n\nI thought I could find something working among the indicators on tradingview, but what was my surprise when I checked about 4000 indicators in a few days (just to avoid writing the code myself, yes) and found out that absolutely nothing worked. It may work on the history with perfect settings, but as soon as you change a stock or a crypto coin, it doesn’t work. You know it yourself. I decided that maybe there is something good among the paid indicators on the Internet, but I did not find anything there except for outright scams or the same non-working indicators.\n\nTeaching her my trading system to start every morning by looking for levels is not a good idea. She has too much to do around the house. So I had to create my own indicator so that it would take her minimum time to trade. Now I don’t have to start every morning looking for strong support and resistance levels on the charts. And to my mom, of course, because I originally created the indictor for her. She places orders in the morning and closes them in the evening before going to bed if she is happy with the profit.\n\nPaul Lenosky\nI foresee some questions:\nDo I need to configure anything for the indicator to work?\n\nI believe that a normal indicator should work immediately, without any customization at all. You run it and it works immediately. The indicator should analyze everything by itself and adjust its settings to the market, otherwise this indicator is useless. It is the full automation that I have realized in this indicator. But for those who like to customize and adjust everything themselves, I have implemented flexible customization options.\n\nOn what timeframes does the indicator work?\n\nThe indicator works on any timeframes. It is important to realize that the level breakout on 1 minute will be much less than on 1 hour timeframe. For those who prefer to place an order and forget about it at least until the next day and not follow it, I advise a timeframe of at least 1 hour.\n\nIs it just for cryptocurrency?\n\nI have run the indicator on charts of shares of world companies and there the levels, behind which stop losses are collected, work the same way. That is, the indicator works on such a market as well. I myself prefer to trade cryptocurrencies.\n\nI would like to add something to the indicator or change something in it. Can I ask for it?\n\nYes, of course, I consider all suggestions and will be sure to add this when possible.\n\nI have a brilliant idea and I want someone to realize it. Can I come to you?\n\nSure, feel free to contact me. I love to write code and I have spent too much time learning Pine script programming language, which is used to create indicators for tradingview, to end up wasting this skill. So do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nHow do I access the indicator?\n\nText me on telegram, please: https://t.me/PaulLenosky or twitter.com/Paullenosky\n\nUpdate: Since I have very little time to respond to private messages right now, please get the latest news on the indicator in my telegram channel: https://t.me/lenoskypaul\n\nSome screenshots\nETHUSDT\nBTCUSDT\nBTCUSDT\nLINKUSDT\nSOLUSDT\nSEIUSDT\nSEIUSDT\nIf you would like to discuss the indicator or get one, please contact me on telegram: t.me/PaulLenosky or twitter.com/Paullenosky\nUpdate: Since I have very little time to respond to private messages right now, please get the latest news on the indicator in my telegram channel: https://t.me/lenoskypaul\n\nIf you still have any doubts about this strategy working, I can provide at least 500 videos of trading this breakout strategy.\n\nI want to create a community that will collectively improve the indicator, at least with their advice.\n\nThank you for reading this long article. Please, if you also have ideas on how to improve the indicator, contact me. There’s no limit to perfection.\n\nI edited the article a bit, as it seems that many people did not realize that the point of the indicator is that you select the minimum number of touch to draw the level and only then the level will be displayed. For example, if there were 2 touches to the level, and you set the minimum to 3, then the level will not be displayed. Thus, you can set, for example, a minimum of 10 touches to display a level, set a notification to search for such levels and do not look at the chart again until you receive a notification that such a strong level has been found. Believe me, a level that the price has hit 10 times, there will be the strongest breakout and the price will fly into space.\n\nSubscribe to my Medium to read about the next updates. Also don’t forget to give it a like.\n\nThere is a new article on how to trade this strategy:\n\nmedium.com/p/e4f43ccbb85d",2300
